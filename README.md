# Classification
Create a classification model to predict whether price range of mobile based on certain specifications. Report the model with the best accuracy.
Steps to consider:
1)Remove handle null values (if any).
2)Split data into training and test data.
3)Apply the following models on the training dataset and generate the predicted value for
the test dataset
a) Logistic Regression
b) KNN Classification
c) SVM Classifier with linear and rbf kernel
4)Predict the price range for test data
5)Compute Confusion matrix and classification report for each of these models.
6)Report the model with the best accuracy.
